Code to generate poster for PyConES2019 conference
==================================================

This folder includes some (ugly) code to generate a poster to show this library at PyConES2019.

The result is included in the same folder.

If you want to run the scripts you will need to install `scikit-extremes` and its dependencies and 
`reportlab` and `qrcode` libraries.

The result is far from beautiful :-) but this time I wanted to do it that way.
